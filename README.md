## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

The main goal for this project was getting used to working with an external API using fetch API and https://shrtco.de/docs

- Learned to use the useRef hook in this project for locking onto the input[text] for url shortening when user clicks on one of the two call to action buttons at the top and bottom on the webpage.
- Overall practice using CSS and styling with a mobile first approach containing: navigation, hero section, main content, about seciton, and a footer.
